## Customer's Brand & Style

A business customer of yours needs help with their new concept’s illustration by creating magic prompts. They are a long-time customer and you are familiar with their final illustration style which is outlined below:

- **Abstract Representation**: Include "abstract elements" to represent ideas or concepts symbolically rather than through direct depiction. Utilize shapes, lines, and forms to suggest subjects, inviting viewers to engage with the imagery on a deeper level.
- **Minimalism**: Emphasize "minimalism" in your artwork, focusing on simplicity and the essence of the subject. Keep the composition clean and uncluttered, using a few essential elements to convey the message. This approach should be reflected in the use of bold shapes, open space, and clean lines to avoid textures and shadows ensuring the final image has a clear focus and a visually soothing aesthetic.
- **Contrasting and Harmonious Color Schemes**: Utilize a "contrasting" or "harmonious color scheme" with selected shades to maintain simplicity and visual harmony. Colors should be chosen to complement each other and support the design's minimalistic approach, without overwhelming the viewer.
- **Utilization of White Color**: Employ "white" strategically to enhance "balance and harmony," "contrast," and leverage "negative space" within your designs. This color should not distract but rather enable the main elements to stand out.
- **Monochromatic Color Scheme**: Utilize a "monochromatic color scheme" focusing on solid colors to maintain visual harmony and simplicity. Choose one color and apply it in bold, solid forms throughout your design, minimizing the use of shades, tints, and gradients.
- **Negative Space**: Skillfully employ "negative space" to highlight elements or create depth. This technique involves strategically leaving parts of the canvas blank to form shapes or add emphasis, turning the absence of content into a visual tool that enhances the overall composition.
- **Hand-drawn and Artistic Touch**: Ensure the artwork has a "hand-drawn" and "artistic touch" by incorporating "variable line widths" to create depth and a "hand-drawn" appearance. Use thinner lines for basic outlines and thicker lines to emphasize key features. The use of a heavy marker is preferred. However, pencil tools can be used in some cases.
- **Colors:** Use of these brand colors are encouraged. Please use the name in the magic prompts.

## Magic Prompt Examples

Here are some good examples of magic prompts you have created based on your previous creative concept work which includes a concept, your thinking, and a detailed illustration description.
 
<example index="1">
  <concept>
    * Subject: Third-party testing as a key ingredient of AI policy.
    * Concept: A hand marking todo items on a clipboard.
    * Thinking: Policy compliance is usually driven by a very well-known set of benchmarks or requirements. A report is typically generated. Using a clipboard could be seen from anyone's perspective. Either from an independent software vendor (ISV) doing the policy checking or from the AI company's needed compliance perspective. The list should be mostly incomplete indicating work to be done from any perspective.
    * Illustration Description: An arm with a hand, holding a pencil and marking a checklist on a white sheet of paper attached to a clipboard. On the white paper, there are four wavy lines representing a text list. Each line has a checkbox to the left. Only the first line is checked as complete, leaving the other three undone. The clipboard and basic clip, like the hand, are simple outlines showing the darker contrasting background color.
  </concept>
  <magic-prompt>
    A minimalist and abstract illustration, hand-drawn with bold, heavy strokes in black marker on a Medium Gray canvas. This visual captures a hand in the motion of ticking off a box on a clipboard. The clipboard itself, sketched in black, holds a piece of paper where two lines are drawn, suggesting a short checklist. The first box, prominently colored in Red Sharpie Marker, contrasts with the last box, which remains unchecked, symbolizing the start of a fulfilling process.

<example index="2">
  <concept>
    * Subject: Core Views on AI Safety: When, Why, What, and How
    * Concept: A hand removing a stone from the middle of a structured pile.
    * Thinking: The hand is grabbing a stone which would cause the ones above it to fall if removed. This illustrates a basic concept of "Safety" as the stones above could hurt your hand. Or it could illustrate the "How" of safety and if done wrong could cause negative impacts in other areas.
    * Illustration Description: An arm with a hand from the left side is holding onto a stone in the middle of a small pile. The stone being pulled out is important and uses a secondary color. The stones get smaller as they are stacked up 3 or 4 high. The pile consists roughly of 7 to 9 stones of varying circular sizes. The overall background is a lighter primary color.
  </concept>
  <magic-prompt>
    A minimalist and abstract illustration, hand-drawn with bold, heavy strokes in black marker on a Light Tan canvas. The focus is on a pyramid-shaped pile of 6-7 simple, unshaded circles representing stones. The imbalance is accentuated by the off-center placement. From the left, a simple hand reaches into the pile, firmly grasping a stone in the center which is using a Red Sharpie marker color. The overall effect is an intriguing balance of simplicity and complexity, evoking a sense of curiosity and intrigue.
