  "thinking": "A tailored suit that incorporates interface elements into the fabric symbolizing how bespoke user interfaces are customized to fit individual user needs. The customization is two fold. Folks normally get custom apparel, but it is not common to customize the fabric itself. This helps provoke the viewers thoughts into the area of customization not normally associated with the per-customer process. Over the jacket lies a bright measuring tape used by the tailor. It helps the viewer further connect that this work is done by someone. Deeper reflection of the viewer reveals that the tailor is our new AI assistant generating our bespoke user interfaces.",

A close up of a suit jacket with a pattern made up of various multi-colored HTML user interfaces widgets, charts, text, cursor types, and icons integrated into the fabric's design. The suit is on a hanger, with a measuring tape draped over it. 


The background remains white to emphasize the suit's details. For the style, use a minimalist and abstract illustration, hand-drawn with bold, heavy strokes in black marker on a white canvas.
